## Contributing
This project is still in it's nascent stages, there is plenty of room to contribute! 
Feel free to branch or fork this repo and PR for contributing or for personal use.

At the moment, there is not strict coding standards. I would just expect it to 
be clean enough to understand.

If you are passionate about this topic and have large scale feature ideas, 
or ideas on how to better achieve the goals of this package, feel free to reach out! 
I would love to work with you to make this better for everyone.     

Maybe one day we will get a perfect bracket.
